<b>Random Word Generator for Anki</b>
<p>An Anki add-on for generating random lists of words from input text files.</p>
<p>Useful for practicing vocabulary by trying to write a creative story that includes the generated words, or just for
    finding
    interesting words you never knew existed!</p>
<p>To use with your word list, copy your file containing blank-delimited words to the <code>wordlists</code>
    subdirectory in the add-on's directory. The file should have the <code>txt</code> extension. Word lists for some
    languages are included with the add-on.</p>
<p>The add-on can either be used to generate a list of words from the the add-on icon in the note editor and the menu
    item in the Tools menu of the main screen, or it can be used as a filter in your card templates to dynamically
    generate different lists each time you see a card.</p>
<p>The add-on's custom filter is named <code>randlist</code> and it has some options to customize its behavior:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>{{randlist words=en start=1000 end=2000 length=10:}}
</div></code></code></pre>
<ul>
    <li>The <code>words</code> option denotes the input file in the <code>wordlists</code> subdirectory you want to generate the list from. It should be written
        without <code>.txt</code>. The default value is <code>en</code>.</li>
    <li><code>start</code> denotes the position in the input list to start randomly choosing words from. The default is
        <code>0</code> (0-based indexing is used).
    </li>
    <li><code>end</code> denotes the position in input list to limit chosen words to the ones before it (the word at
        index <code>end</code> is excluded). The default is the length of the input list, so words are chosen from the whole list.</li>
    <li><code>length</code> denotes the number of words in the generated list. The default is the magic number
        <code>7</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>, and <code>length</code> options are useful if you have a word list sorted
    by frequency (i.e. a frequency list),
    and only want to get words from a certain range, like the first 5000 words so that you concentrate on learning the
    most
    common words first.</p>
