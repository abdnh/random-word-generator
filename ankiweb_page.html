<b>Random Word Generator for Anki</b>

An Anki add-on for generating random lists of words from input text files.
Useful for practicing vocabulary by trying to write a creative story that includes the generated words, or just for
finding interesting words you never knew existed!

To use with your word list, copy your file containing blank-delimited words to the <code>user_files/wordlists</code> subfolder
in the add-on's folder. The file should have the <code>txt</code> extension. Word lists for some languages are
included with the add-on in the <code>default_wordlists</code> folder.

The add-on can either be used to generate a list of words from the the add-on icon in the note editor and the menu item
in the Tools menu of the main screen, or it can be used as a filter in your card templates to dynamically generate
different lists each time you see a card.
The add-on's custom filter is named <code>randlist</code> and it has some options to customize its behavior:
<code>{{randlist words=en start=1000 end=2000 length=10:}}</code>
<ul>
<li>The <code>words</code> option denotes the input file in the wordlists folders you want to generate the list from. It should be written without <code>.txt</code>. The default value is <code>en</code>.</li>
<li><code>start</code> denotes the position in the input list to start randomly choosing words from. The default is <code>0</code> (0-based indexing is used).</li>
<li><code>end</code> denotes the position in input list to limit chosen words to the ones before it (the word at index <code>end</code> is excluded). The default is the length of the input list, so words are chosen from the whole list.</li>
<li><code>length</code> denotes the number of words in the generated list. The default is the magic number <code>7</code>.</li>
</ul>
The <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>, and <code>length</code> options are useful if you have a word list sorted by frequency (i.e. a frequency list), and only want to get words from a certain range, like the first 5000 words so that you concentrate on learning the most common words first.
